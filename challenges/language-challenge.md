# Language Challenge

The language challenge addresses the idiosyncratic nature of spoken language and individual speech patterns, including informal expressions, ungrammatical structures, colloquialisms, and domain-specific terminology.

## Sub-challenges
- Linguistic noise (e.g., filler words, disfluencies)
- Content repetition (speakers restating or rephrasing information)
- Domain-specific terminology (e.g., medical jargon)

## Progress
**Status**: ðŸŸ  Good progress through pre-training and additional training tasks
