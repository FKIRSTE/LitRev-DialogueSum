# Structure Challenge

The structure challenge focuses on extracting a conversation's built-up, identifying topic flow, dialogue phases, and analyzing utterance dependencies to create an ordered summary based on the extracted structures.

## Sub-challenges
- Topic flow (relationships between discussion topics and transitions)
- Dialogue phases (e.g., problem identification, decision making)
- Utterance dependency (relationships between utterances across turns)
- Long-range dependencies (tracking relationships across distant parts of dialogue)

## Progress
**Status**: ðŸŸ  Good progress through graph structures and multi-stage approaches
