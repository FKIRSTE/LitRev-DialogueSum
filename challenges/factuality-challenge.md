# Factuality Challenge

The factuality challenge addresses the reliability of generated summaries, focusing on preventing both extrinsic errors (hallucinations of events not present in the original transcript) and intrinsic errors (misrepresentation of actual event details).

## Sub-challenges
- Extrinsic errors (hallucinating events not in the transcript)
- Intrinsic errors (misrepresenting event details)
- Coreference resolution errors
- Negation handling

## Progress
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Remains challenging, especially with complex inferences

## Technical Approaches for Factuality

### Factuality Verification Methods
- **Entailment-based Verification**: Using NLI models to verify factual consistency
- **QA-based Verification**: Generating questions about the summary and verifying answers
- **Triple-based Verification**: Extracting subject-predicate-object triples for comparison
- **Graph-based Verification**: Comparing semantic graphs of dialogue and summary

### Error Correction Approaches
- **Deliberate-then-generate**: Multi-step generation with factuality verification
- **Edit-based Correction**: Editing generated summaries to fix factual errors
- **Slot-driven Generation**: Using semantic slots to guide factual generation
- **Constrained Decoding**: Constraining generation to maintain factuality

### Training Strategies
- **Contrastive Fine-tuning**: Training with factual vs. non-factual examples
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Rewarding factually consistent summaries
- **Auxiliary Tasks**: Training on factuality-specific auxiliary tasks
- **Multi-task Learning**: Combining summarization with factuality prediction

## Recent Developments: Impact of LLMs

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may reduce but not eliminate factuality challenges:

- Improved general knowledge and reasoning capabilities
- Better context integration across long spans of text
- Advanced semantic understanding
- However, hallucination remains a significant issue with LLMs

Recent work (Laskar et al., 2023; Mullick et al., 2024) indicates that:
- Carefully prompted LLMs can achieve competitive factuality performance
- Multi-stage approaches with LLMs show promise for factuality improvement
- Chain-of-thought prompting may enhance factual reasoning
- Retrieval augmentation can further ground LLM generations in source content
