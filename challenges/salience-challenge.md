# Salience Challenge

The salience challenge involves identifying and focusing on the most relevant information within a dialogue, including content critical for insightful summaries and information relevant to specific audiences.

## Sub-challenges
- Identifying content critical for insightful summaries
- Aligning summaries with different viewpoints, values, and ethics
- Locating relevant text spans in lengthy dialogues
- Adapting to dynamic, evolving information flow
- Personalizing summaries to individual needs

## Progress
**Status**: ðŸŸ  Good progress through contrastive learning and prompt engineering

## Technical Approaches for Salience

### Content Prioritization Methods
- **Contrastive Learning**: Using positive and negative examples to distinguish important content
- **Entity Planning**: Prioritizing named entities to guide summary generation
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifying core topics as a basis for extracting salient information
- **Centrality Measures**: Computing various centrality metrics to identify key information

### Representation Techniques
- **Mixed-Attribute Control**: Explicitly modeling content attributes (length, specificity, etc.)
- **Global-Local Attention**: Balancing global document understanding with local detail focus
- **Query-Based Filtering**: Using explicit or implicit queries to filter important content
- **Importance Scoring**: Assigning importance scores to dialogue segments
