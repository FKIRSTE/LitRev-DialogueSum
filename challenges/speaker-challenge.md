# Speaker Challenge

The speaker challenge addresses tracking participants, their roles, interactions, and references to entities and other participants, including role changes across topics.

## Sub-challenges
- Individual participant roles (e.g., 'project manager', 'customer service agent')
- Topic-dependent role changes
- Participant interactions and contributions
- References to entities and other participants

## Progress
**Status**: ðŸŸ  Good progress through special attention mechanisms and graph-based models
